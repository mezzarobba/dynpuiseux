# Puiseux expansions by dynamic evaluation

Experimental SageMath code for computing Puiseux series expansions of solutions
of algebraic equations. This implementation is similar to gfun:-algeqtoseries in
Maple. Its highlight compared to other SageMath implementations of the
Newton-Puiseux algorithm is that it supports equations depending on rational
parameters.
